event-manager
=============

Simple program that 
  I/O from a CSV, 
  parses it, 
  manipulates strings, 
  accesses Sunlight's Congressional API via the Sunlight Congress gem, and 
  uses ERB for templating
  
Shoutout to [JumpstartLab](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html) for the wonderful introduction to Ruby.
